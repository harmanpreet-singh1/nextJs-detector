# Privacy Policy for Next.js Detector

**Last Updated:** 4th March 2025

Thank you for using **Next.js Detector**, a Chrome extension designed to help developers detect whether a webpage is built using the Next.js framework. Your privacy is important to us, and we are committed to protecting it. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information in connection with the use of our extension.

---

## 1. Data Collection

**Next.js Detector does not collect, store, or share any personal or browsing data.** The extension operates entirely locally within your browser and does not transmit any data to external servers or third parties.

The extension uses the following permissions:

- **`activeTab`**: To temporarily access the active tab when you click the extension icon.
- **`scripting`**: To inject and execute JavaScript code in the active tab for detecting Next.js-specific patterns.
- **`tabs`**: To query and interact with browser tabs to ensure the script runs in the correct tab.

These permissions are used solely for the functionality of the extension and do not involve any data collection.

## 2. How the Extension Works

Next.js Detector analyzes the DOM and JavaScript environment of the active tab to detect whether the webpage is built using Next.js. Specifically, it checks for:

- The presence of the `window.__NEXT_DATA__` global variable.
- Script tags containing `_next/static` in their source.

This analysis is performed locally in your browser, and no data is shared with us or any third parties.

## 3. Third-Party Services

Next.js Detector does not use any third-party services, APIs, or libraries that collect user data.

## 4. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated revision date. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically to stay informed about how we are protecting your information.
